# Binary Tree README

## General
Welcome to the Binary Tree README! This document serves as a guide to understanding binary trees, their variations, properties, and common traversal methods.

## What is a Binary Tree?
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These children are also nodes, thus forming subtrees.

## Difference between Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree (BST)
While both are binary trees, a Binary Search Tree (BST) has an additional property: for any node, the left child contains values smaller than the node's value, and the right child contains values greater than the node's value. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Gain in Time Complexity Compared to Linked Lists
Binary trees offer significant gains in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists, particularly for search, insert, and delete operations. While linked lists have linear time complexity (O(n)) for these operations, binary trees can achieve logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) on average, making them more efficient for large datasets.

## Binary Tree Properties
- **Depth:** The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node.
- **Height:** The height of a tree is the maximum depth of any node in the tree.
- **Size:** The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes in the tree.

## Traversal Methods
Traversal methods are techniques to visit all nodes of a binary tree in a specific order. Common traversal methods include:
- **In-order traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.
- **Pre-order traversal:** Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
- **Post-order traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.

## Types of Binary Trees
- **Complete Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
- **Full Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
- **Perfect Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaves are at the same level.
- **Balanced Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which the depth of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most one.

Understanding these types of binary trees can help in designing efficient algorithms and data structures.

## Conclusion
Binary trees are fundamental data structures with various applications in computer science. By understanding their properties, variations, and traversal methods, you can efficiently manipulate and analyze hierarchical data structures in your applications.
